# SudokuSolver
## Solves a Sudoku puzzle
Simply run the program, and then input the (unsolved) sudoku puzzle as such (line-by-line, newline between lines):
  - Enter the number if it is known,
  - Put an underscore ('_') if the value is not given. These are the values the program will compute to finish the puzzle,
  - Separate each character in a line with one (1) space.
  
After entering the last line, the program will automagically begin solving, and will likely be done faster than you can blink. If this is not the case either:
  - The puzzle is unsolvable or requires "guessing" to complete,
  - You have input the puzzle incorrectly,
  - This code does not contain enough logical checks to ensure a puzzle can always be completed (Make a github issue, please!).

Happy sudoku-ing!
